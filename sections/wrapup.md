When should you use OptaPlanner?


Whenever you have a planning problem!


I liked the concepts, but I didn't like...


Drools

* EasyRules, an annotation based POJO solution
* Clara, an easy to read Clojure solution
* OptaPlanner can work with pure Java


Java

* Kotlin and Groovy work with OptaPlanner and Drools
* Off the JVM, options are limited and expensive
* Microsoft seems to have an option


OptaPlanner

* Most alternatives are scientific
* Scilab, Mathematica, MATLAB


The Examples

* What would you like to see?

* Lab next month!


The Presentation

* Color scheme?

* Pacing?

* Content?

Let me know afterwards or on Meetup!
