# Planning Problems


Any problem that your instinct tells you can only be solved via brute force

e.g. Traveling Sales problem


Any problem with both "valid" and "good" solutions

e.g. Online video game matchmaking


Any problem that you want to randomly generate solutions for, and have humans check

e.g. Schedule management


Any pure data organization problem that a person says 

"I can do a better job at that than a machine" 

(they're wrong)


In general:

Schedules (Shift, School, Conference)

Assignments (Teams, Projects, Tutors)

Resource Allocation (CPU, Traveling Sales, etc.)


Specifically:

Hosted buyer conferences

Online matchmaking

Tutor schedules
